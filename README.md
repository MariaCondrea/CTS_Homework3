The game I have worked on during my practical stage is called Zombie Toys and it is a third-person endless shooter/arcade game where the player, a young boy or girl, has awoken to find out that their toys came to life as zombies who threaten them. The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible, as the player avoids being hurt by the zombified toys, as well as killing the toys. Points are earned by shooting the monsters using a special remote control toy, having four attacks available, Lightning Attack, Frost Attack, Stink Bomb and Slime Attack. By gaining points, the player might spawn an ally, which will attract the enemies, giving the player a chance to take them down.

The game was based on the coding the behaviors of the players, the enemies or the attacks, and the design of the game UI, creating the players, using prefabs to create them, how lightning is important in a video game and how it can change the overall effect of the gameplay by adding physics to it. The game is playable on PC and Android phones.

In order to describe the gameâ€™s specs from a clean code POV, the following design patterns can be used:
